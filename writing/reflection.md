## Performance Analysis

The efficiency algorithm is faster by about 50-51%. When the number 49979687 was inputted in for the primality exhaustive testing it ran with a duration of 4.714, and the efficiennt ran at 2.305 this meant that the difference in time was about 51%. However, when the number 103553 ran in both functions it was found to be almost exactly 50% faster. This means that the efficient function was running at half the time of the exhaustive function due to the Bisection of the potential answers. The efficient function will guess an answer at about the middle point for the possible answers and then if it is wrong it will decide if the answer should be above or below their previous guess and it will throw away half of the possible answers to the question. Then it will effectively continue to cut down the answers to this question and that's why it takes about half the time for the efficient function to run.

Also in regards to my input: 12345678, one will notice that it gives the response that there are "no samples recorded". This does not mean that the function didn't operate correctly it means that the function ran so fast that pyinstrument, which is the profiler that collects the data on the function, can't collect data on the function. What I mean by this is that pyinstrument collects data every millisecond but if the function finishes running before the millisecond is over then pyinstrument will not be able to collect any data on that function.

## Source Code

### Describe in detail how the completed source code works

#### A function that converts a `bool` into a human readable `str` value

```
def human_readable_boolean(answer: bool) -> str:
    """Produce a human-readable Yes or No for a boolean value of True or False."""
    # produce a human-readable value for a bool
    # True --> "Yes"
    # False --> "No"
    if answer != True:
        return "No"
    else:
        return "Yes"
```

This code is telling the function to assign the variable "answer" to an inputed boolean and then convert it into a string value. Then the finction will move into a if statement that suggests that if the variable answer (or the number inputted) is not equal to True, meaning that it is not a prime number, than the function will return the word "No". However, if the function determines that the number is a prime number (or True) then it will file into the else statement which will return the word "Yes".

#### A function signature that defines the command-line interface for `primality`

```
@cli.command()
def primality(
    number: int = typer.Option(5),
    profile: bool = typer.Option(False),
    approach: PrimalityTestingApproach = PrimalityTestingApproach.efficient,
) -> None:
    """Use iteration to perform primality testing on a number and run a profiling data collection if requested."""
    # create a console for rich text output
    console = Console()
    # create an empty primality_tuple
    primality_tuple: Tuple[bool, List[int]]
    # use the efficient primality testing algorithm
    if approach.value == PrimalityTestingApproach.efficient:
        # Reference for more details:
        # https://github.com/joerick/pyinstrument
        # perform profiling on the execution of the primality test
        profiler.start()
        primality_tuple = primality_test_efficient(number)
        # do not perform profiling
        profiler.stop()
    # use the exhaustive primality testing algorithm
    elif approach.value == PrimalityTestingApproach.exhaustive:
        # Reference for more details:
        # https://github.com/joerick/pyinstrument
        profiler.start()
        primality_tuple = primality_test_exhaustive(number)
        # perform profiling on the execution of the primality test
        # do not perform profiling
        profiler.stop()
    # display the results of the primality test
    was_prime_found = primality_tuple[0]
    divisor_list = primality_tuple[1]
    console.print(f":smile: Attempting to determine if {number} is a prime number!")
    console.print()
    console.print(
        f":sparkles: What divisors were found? {pretty_print_list(divisor_list)}"
    )
    console.print(
        f":sparkles: Was this a prime number? {human_readable_boolean(was_prime_found)}"
    )
    # display the results of the profiling if that option was requested
    if profile:
        console.print()
        console.print(
            f":microscope: Here's profile data from performing primality testing on {number}!"
        )
        profiler.print()
```

This is essentially the function that calls upon all the other functions in the file. It first takes the variable "number" and defines it as an integer, then it defines the variable "profile" as a boolean, and finally it defines "approach" as None but only through the efficient function. The it uses an if statement to approach a value which the user inputs and tells the computer to approach the value through the efficient function. Then it will start the profiler and call upon the primality_tuple variable which it originally defined as a boolean and a list of integers. Then it will, finally, officially call upon the primality_test_efficient function and ask for the variable "number" which as you may recall it already defined as an integer. Once the primality_test_efficient function completes it's job the profiler will stop, and the function will determine if it needs the futher elif statment from line 27 of the above code.
If the function determines that the user is trying to approach the number not from an efficient perspective but from an exahustive approach, it will use everything below the elif statement. It will start the profiler then, using the primality_tuple variable it will call upon the primality_test_exhaustive function looking for the variable "number" and once that function has done its job the bigger function will tell the profiler to stop.
Then the function will move into determining what needs to be printed based on the data it found. If the function determines that the number was prime it will print the yes statement from the bool function if not it will print no. It will also print the number and its smallest divisor if it was not prime.

### What was the greatest challenge that you faced when completing this assignment?

The greatest challenge I faced when trying to run this code was that I couldn't figure out why the pyinstrument wouldn't install on my computer. I was getting a lot of weird errors that made me panick and think that I actually did mess something up when we were in SOS week, but Coby came over and helped me figure out that the actual issue was that I already had the package installed and the computer didnt want me to install it again.

### Based on your experiences with this project, what is one way in which you want to improve?

I think I said this in a previous lab, but I still get hungup in how to start things and how to be confident enough to try things even if it doesnt seem like they will work. I just need to get better at using the todos to figure out what is being asked of me.
