# Primality Testing

## Evelyn Griffith

## Program Output

### Use six fenced code blocks to provide output from different runs of `primality` with different inputs

`poetry run primality --number 49979687 --approach efficient`

## Performance Analysis

TODO: Provide one paragraph that states which algorithm is fastest, by how much
it is faster, and how you knew that the it was faster, referencing the data in
the aforementioned command outputs to support your response.

## Source Code
